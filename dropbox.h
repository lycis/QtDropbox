/*!
  QDropbox provides you with all utilities required to connect to any Dropbox account. For purposes of
  connection this class provides an asynchronous, signal and slot based, interface.

  <h3>Connection to new account</h3>
  If you want to initiate a new connection to an account that did not authorize your application to
  access it you use requestToken() and then you have to call requestAccessToken as soon as the signal
  requestTokenFinished() is emitted.

  If the token you are using is not authorized or is expired the signal tokenExpired() will be emitted.
  In this case you have to prompt the user for reauthorization of your application. A link to the
  authoriziation interface of Dropbox is provided by the function authorizeLink(). This API does not
  automatise the authorization process as this feature is not provided by Dropbox. So you have to
  display the link in a web browser.

  To reconnect to an account on a later use of your application you have to save the token and token
  secret obtained after requestAccessToken(). These values are provided by the functions token() and
  tokenSecret().

  <h3>Connection to authorized account</h3>
  If the account you want to connect to has already authorized your application and you already
  have obtained an authorized token and token secret you will use a shortcut to connect. You have
  to set the token and token secret you obtained by a prior use of the API with the according
  functions setToken() and setTokenSecret(). You do not need to invoke requestToken() or
  requestAccessToken(). These functions are only called at first use or if no token and token secret
  are available.

  Should the token or token secret you are using be already expired the signal tokenExpired()
  will be emitted. In that case you have to prompt the user for reauthorization.

  <h3>Using blocking requests</h3>
  Every function that requests information from the server has a blocking and non-blocking function.
  A blocking request will wait until the server has responded to your query before returning while a
  non-blocking request will return immediately. Usually a blocking function directly returns a result
  and a non-blocking function will emit an according signal as the request has finished.

  \warning The use of a blocking function will reset the current error flag. So after calling a blocking
  function the function error() will return QDropbox::NoError if no error occurred or the error that
  occurred when processing the blocking request.
